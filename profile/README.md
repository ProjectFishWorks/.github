## Hi there 👋

We are looking to build an aquarium monitoring solution, allowing consumers to build a system
comprised of off the shelf components that can centrally manage all aspects of their fish ecosystem.
At the heart of our control system is a modular design allowing for a consumer to purchase only the
components they require, while being expandable to allow for growth and new aquariums. The
system is centrally controlled by a base station with onboard storage and a display for status,
warnings and user controllable options. The base station will connect to other nodes which will
control and monitor peripheral devices such as temperature and utilize this information to
implement fail-safes such as power control. All data and control will be accessible through a web app
allowing for real time monitoring, historical data, direct system control as well as setting user defined
limits and alarm values.

This organization contains all code, design documents, and documentation for the first protype of this project. This prototype was completed for our final term capstone project at Camosun College, Victoria BC.

All general documentation can be found in the [documentation repo.](https://github.com/ProjectFishWorks/Documentation)

Node controller related files can be found in [Node Controller](https://github.com/ProjectFishWorks/NodeController) and [Node Controller Core](https://github.com/ProjectFishWorks/NodeControllerCore)

Base station files can be found in [Base Station](https://github.com/ProjectFishWorks/BaseStation)

The code for our web app can be found in [Web App](https://github.com/ProjectFishWorks/WebApp)
